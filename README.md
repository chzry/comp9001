**This is a virtual pet-raising mini-game, where the pet is a crow. The game also includes a water reminder function to help you stay hydrated.**


———————————————————————————————————————————————


**Features:**

**1. Pet**

When the crow is still in the egg, you can interact with it daily by choosing the pet command.
Once the hatch value reaches 10, the crow will break out of its shell!

⚠️ Note: You can only pet it once per day.


**2. Feeding**

After the little crow hatches from the egg, you no longer need to pet it.
You can now feed it once a day using the feed command.
When the feed value reaches 10, the little crow will grow into a big crow.
After that, feeding is no longer necessary.

⚠️ Note: Feeding is also limited to once per day.


**3. View**

Whenever you want to check on your crow’s current status, use the [view] command, and the game will display your crow's appearance.


**4. Game**

This is a number guessing game. After the crow hatches, you can play this game with it.
The crow will randomly think of a number between 1 and 200. Try to guess it correctly to win!


**5. Water Reminder**

Regardless of your crow’s growth stage, you can turn on the water reminder feature at any time by entering the [wateron] command.
The game will then remind you to drink water every 30 minutes.
To disable the reminder, use the [wateroff] command.
